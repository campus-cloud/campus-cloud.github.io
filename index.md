# About Campus Cloud 
Campus Cloud is an application that provides a clean, easy-to-use interface to view and explore all of the Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs) at UH MƒÅnoa. Users can explore the RIO list and view details about specific clubs. Then we have registered users who will be able to have an account to list their interests so that they can be alerted upon conception of a new club matching their interests. Admins will be able to create a club and assign an owner to the club with which the club owner will be able to edit the club to their preferences. With our application, we're hoping to allow ease of access to view all of the clubs at UH and make it even easier to find the clubs that may interest you.

We created rough mockups of various pages in order to conceptually define what we wanted on each page.
